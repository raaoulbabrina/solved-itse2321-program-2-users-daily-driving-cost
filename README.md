<br>
The daily driving cost is based on total miles driven per day, cost per gallon of gas, average miles per gallon, parking fees per day, and tolls per day using the formula below:

<strong>Daily Driving Cost = Cost Per Gallon * Total Miles Driven ÷ Average Miles Per Gallon                                    +  Parking Fees Per Day + Tolls Per Day </strong>

Write a program that calculates a user’s daily driving cost.  The program should ask the user for the following data and display the user’s cost per day.  Format your output to two decimal places:

<ol>

 <li>Total miles driven per day</li>

 <li>Cost of gallon of gasoline</li>

 <li>Average miles per gallon of gasoline</li>

 <li>Parking fees</li>

 <li>Tolls per day</li>

</ol>




Run your program <strong>two times,</strong> with the following data, and copy and paste the output to a file.
